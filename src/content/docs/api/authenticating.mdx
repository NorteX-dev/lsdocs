title: Authenticating
description: Light Services bot API reference.

In order to use any of the endpoints, you need to authorize the request. You can do that using the `X-Api-Key` header.

First, configure your keys. In your configuration, scroll to `api.keys` and type in your keys, like so:

[//]: # "![api.keys key in config.yml]()"

api.keys key in config.yml

A key can be anything, but it should be long and secure. You can generate a secure key using a tool like [this [UUID v4 Generator]](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4).

Then, when sending a request, include any of the above-defined keys it in the request `headers`:

```http
GET https://your.domain/endpoint
headers: {
	"X-Api-Key": "YOUR KEY HERE"
}
```

After authenticating, the API will allow you to make actions.

:::danger
**Never** share your API key(s). They allow full, unmoderated control over your bot, and therefore, your Discord server as well. Use with care.
