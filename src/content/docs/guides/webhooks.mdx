title: Payment notification webhooks
description: Advanced setup for automatic payment updates from PayPal, Coinbase and Stripe.
---

Payment notification webhooks allow for automatic invoice payment updates from PayPal, Coinbase Commerce and Stripe.

### Prerequisites

**This guide is intended for advanced users only.**

You will require:

-   a server with full root access;
-   be able to open ports on your server in order to allow external communication with the bots internal Rest API;
-   a valid SSL certificate (or a service that provides you one, like Cloudflare).

:::caution
If you can't expose the webhook (for any of the reasons outlined above), you will still be able to create & manage invoices, however their status won't update automatically.

You can update their status manually using `/invoice refresh` every once in a while.

**If this solution is fine with you, you can skip this guide.**
:::

**This guide assumes the [basic installation](/guides/installation) & [payment](/guides/paypal) guides have been followed.**

### Terminology

Both PayPal and Coinbase Commerce send events (like updates to payments) to your bot's API via webhooks.

This means that the platform will send a POST request to your bot's URL, which will then update the invoice's status.

[Read more about webhook-driven event updates ðŸ¡¥](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/webhooks/)

The bot's API must thus be enabled & open to the public and accessible from the internet. It must also run on HTTPS (SSL), as per PayPal's, Stripe's and Coinbase's requirements.

You can achieve this in multiple ways, for example by proxying the website through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or providing your own key & certificate files.

### Port Reference

By default, the bot exposes the API endpoint on port `2020` for HTTP and `2021` for HTTPS (using key.pem and cert.pem files).
Ports can be configured in your `config.yml` file, under the `api` section.

We recommend setting up a reverse proxy using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to proxy the bot's API to a subdomain.

> Before configuring PayPal, Coinbase or Stripe webhooks make sure the API works by visiting the root endpoint (/) in your browser.

### Set up

:::tip[Endpoints]
The endpoint for _PayPal_ invoice updates is available at `/ipn/paypal`.

The endpoint for _Coinbase Commerce_ payment updates is available at `/ipn/coinbase`.

The endpoint for _Stripe_ payment updates is available at `/ipn/stripe`.
