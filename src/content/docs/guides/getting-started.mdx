### Welcome

This website contains a set of guides and references to ease the installation of the Light Services bot.

Light Services bot is a Discord bot made originally for the Light Services development team, hence it's name.
It contains features such as advanced ticket management, hands-off revenue management, automatic PayPal and crypto invoices and much more.

:::caution[Notice]
The bot is intended for _self-hosting_, which means we assume a basic level of understanding of how to manage and make Discord bots.
That includes terminology (like "bot", "token", "server" etc.) and basic knowledge (like opening a terminal and installing the prerequisites).
**We are unlikely to provide support for people who don't have a basic idea about self-hosting**, so please keep this in mind when contacting the team.

### Obtain the LS bot

If you do not own the bot yet, you can obtain a copy (along with its full & unencrypted source code) over at BuiltByBit:
[View on BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/ticket-bot-paypal-invoices.22995/) for just $4.39.

### Panel support

We're aware of many people trying to host this bot on managed panels,
such as [Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/).
The LS bot _partially_ supports this type of hosting, as you might run into problems during automatic payment updates ([IPN updates](/guides/ipn)) setup, due to not being able to open API ports. Read more [here](/guides/ipn).

### Support

If you get stuck anywhere in the guides, find a bug or have any questions, you can contact on our Discord by **clicking the Discord icon in the upper-right corner of your screen** or [here](https://discord.gg/xDBh6mFdpE).
