### Prerequisites

**PayPal invoicing requires a Business account.** You can check whether you have one [here](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accountStatus).

If you do not have a PayPal business account, you can upgrade or create a new one. The application process is different from country to country, so please consult your local PayPal terms.

### Sandbox & Live distinction

PayPal offers a mode that they call _Sandbox_. Sandbox mode is a testing environment with "fake" accounts and money.

If you're not planning on developing the bot further, you should probably use _Live_ mode instead.

You can control whether sandbox mode is enabled using the `gateways.paypal.useSandbox` option in your `config.yml` file.

### Set up

To configure PayPal invoicing:

1. Enable it in your `config.yml` by setting `gateways.paypal.enabled` to `true` and set `gateways.paypal.useSandbox` to `false` (refer to [Sandbox & Live distinction](#sandbox--live-distinction)).

2. Go to the [PayPal Developer Dashboard ðŸ¡¥](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/).
3. Switch the mode over to **Live** and click on **Apps & Credentials**.

4. Create a new PayPal app by clicking "Create App". Name it whatever you want.
5. Copy the generated client ID & client secret.
6. Paste these values into your `config.yml` file.

**After configuring these credentials, invoices should be enabled, however, invoice status won't update.**
You can configure [webhooks updates](/guides/webhooks) to achieve automatic invoice updates, but you don't have to! The bot will work fine and invoices can be updated manually using the command `/invoice refresh`.
